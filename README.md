This is my test repository

old South Austin hippie that has an old hippie Boston Terrier named Giggles

If I commit this will it count as activity? Will this stop the "you're losing your access" email?

Looking for my recovery codes..where did those go?

2024/10 - testing this again. 

Adding a branch so maybe this commit will be more impressive?

Adding this on 11/1/24 to see if this passes the commit muster

Adding one more line on 11/29/24 to see if this gets me through the new year. It's hard being a lurker.
